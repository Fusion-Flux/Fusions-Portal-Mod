# Portal Cubed is being Rewritten!

 Due to this, this repository is now unused in favor of https://github.com/Fusion-Flux/Portal-Cubed-Rewrite and will not be recieving any updates.

If you ended up on this page looking for the most recent version/a playable build, the latest pre-rewrite (v2.3.0) release can be found [in our discord](https://discord.gg/YyrsVRNBA8).  


 **IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE THE VERSIONS IN THE RELEASES TAB** - These exist purely for archival reasons and to not break certain modpacks (such as BlanketCon 23) that pull from them.  They are more issue-prone and tend to have less compatibility with other common mods, so you will not receive any support if you use them.
